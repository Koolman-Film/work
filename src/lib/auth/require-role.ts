/**
 * `requireRole()` — the single role gate for every protected Server Action,
 * Server Component, and Route Handler.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   1. Read the Supabase session (cookie-based via @supabase/ssr).
 *   2. Look up our `User` row by the session's auth.users.id, eagerly
 *      including `employee` and `roleAssignments` (with role definitions).
 *   3. Compute the user's TIER from their assignments (Phase 4 — used
 *      to be `user.role` enum column read).
 *   4. Reject if no user, archived, or tier not in the allowlist.
 *
 * Why one helper:
 *   - Centralizes the authn → authz chain so we can audit/refactor in one place.
 *   - Forces every protected entry point to think "what roles am I gating on?"
 *     by requiring the `roles` argument — no implicit "any logged-in user".
 *
 * Behavior on failure:
 *   - `notFound()` (HTTP 404) on missing session — never reveal "you exist but
 *     aren't allowed", since that leaks which routes exist.
 *   - `notFound()` on tier mismatch too — same reasoning.
 *   - Server Actions called from a logged-out client will see this as a thrown
 *     `NEXT_NOT_FOUND` error; Server Components hit the same path and Next.js
 *     renders the nearest `not-found.tsx`.
 *
 * Why not throw a custom error?
 *   - We tried that. Server Actions can't propagate custom error types cleanly
 *     across the RPC boundary — Next strips them to "An error occurred."
 *   - `notFound()` and `forbidden()` are the two sanctioned Next.js control-flow
 *     mechanisms that survive the boundary; we use `notFound()` uniformly to
 *     avoid signaling existence to unauthorized callers.
 *
 * Phase 4 note: this previously read `user.role` (a legacy enum column).
 * The check now derives the tier from active `UserRoleAssignment` rows
 * via `computeTier`. The prisma `include` was extended to fetch
 * `roleAssignments` in the same round-trip — no additional latency.
 * Phase 4.6 drops the `User.role` column entirely.
 *
 * LIFF admin fallback: an admin paired via /liff/pair-admin keeps their
 * email auth.users id on `User.authUserId`, while their LIFF session is a
 * separate LINE-minted auth user. When the primary authUserId lookup
 * misses, we resolve the session's verified `custom:line` identity sub
 * against `User.lineUserId`. Workers never need this — their pairing
 * binds authUserId to the LINE auth user directly. The returned
 * `authUserId` is always the SESSION auth id (storage-path security
 * checks compare against it), not the User row's column.
